### Tasks
These exercises are designed to help get your hands dirty and familair with Atomic Design practises.
If you're stuck at any point, feel free to ask for assistance or check the 'awnsers' folder for some clues and insight.

No one will be reviewing your work or checking on it's "correctness", that is for you to determine with how you plan to adopt the practises and the product you're building / maintaining.

# Task - Optimise my components
Inside the playground folder you will find a series of components that could be optimised.

### Tasks
- Optimise the runtime performance of all the components
