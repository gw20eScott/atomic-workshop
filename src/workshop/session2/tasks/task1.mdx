### Tasks
These exercises are designed to help get your hands dirty and familair with Atomic Design practises.
If you're stuck at any point, feel free to ask for assistance or check the 'awnsers' folder for some clues and insight.

No one will be reviewing your work or checking on it's "correctness", that is for you to determine with how you plan to adopt the practises and the product you're building / maintaining.

# Task 1 - Make the product list module generic
Let's now make our product list module more generic, so we can tie the same module to different entity types.

### Build a page title typography element
- Add filtering and sorting to the exisitng module
- Add passing different data and different handlers (clicks)
- Make an example of the product list module to support featured products and regular products

### Component Template
You should edit the exisitng module for this exercise.

### Storybook Template

```
const StoryWrapper = (props) => {}

export default {
  component: StoryWrapper,
  args: {
    data: response.data
  }
}

export const ProductsModuleStory = {
  args: {
    title: 'Products',
    data: response.data,
    description: 'The following products are at a discount.'
  }
};

export const ComingSoonProductsModuleStory = {
  args: {
    title: 'Coming Soon',
    data: response.data,
    notForSale: true,
    description: 'The following products are soon on sale.'
  }
};
```
