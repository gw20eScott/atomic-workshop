### Tasks
These exercises are designed to help get your hands dirty and familair with Atomic Design practises.
If you're stuck at any point, feel free to ask for assistance or check the 'awnsers' folder for some clues and insight.

No one will be reviewing your work or checking on it's "correctness", that is for you to determine with how you plan to adopt the practises and the product you're building / maintaining.

# Task 2 - Seperate the Cart from the product list
We want to move the Cart to the sidebar, which means it needs to become it's own module that can respond to a global state.

### TASK:
- Make the Cart a seperate module
- Create a context provider to extend the state across your application
- Cart should update from product clicks of both features and regular items (together)
- Cart should support removing items from the list

### Component Template
You should edit the exisitng module for this exercise, as well as add a new one.
