### Tasks
These exercises are designed to help get your hands dirty and familair with Atomic Design practises.
If you're stuck at any point, feel free to ask for assistance or check the 'awnsers' folder for some clues and insight.

No one will be reviewing your work or checking on it's "correctness", that is for you to determine with how you plan to adopt the practises and the product you're building / maintaining.

# Task 1 - Build support for adding products with a data driven ui
We will be updating our admin panel interface so that the control mechanism is generated with data driven UI.

### Data driven product management
- Feed it the state of products
- Extend the product with more information
- Support checkbox, select, input and textarea
- Support validation
- Document it in storybook
