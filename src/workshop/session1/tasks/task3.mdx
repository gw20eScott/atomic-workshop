### Tasks
These exercises are designed to help get your hands dirty and familair with Atomic Design practises.
If you're stuck at any point, feel free to ask for assistance or check the 'awnsers' folder for some clues and insight.

No one will be reviewing your work or checking on it's "correctness", that is for you to determine with how you plan to adopt the practises and the product you're building / maintaining.

# Task 3 - Build a Card Composition
The product list page needs cards, these cards to support showing the product name, description, image and a button

### Build an Card composition
- Single export or Composition export are both okay
- Give it information on the product
- Click events on the button performs an action
- Clicking the card elsewhere goes to the product page
- Introduce a new button element with primary and secondary variants
- Introduce a new typography elements for the card title and description

### Component Template

import styled from 'styled-components'
