### Tasks
These exercises are designed to help get your hands dirty and familair with Atomic Design practises.
If you're stuck at any point, feel free to ask for assistance or check the 'awnsers' folder for some clues and insight.

No one will be reviewing your work or checking on it's "correctness", that is for you to determine with how you plan to adopt the practises and the product you're building / maintaining.

# Task 5 - Build a Product list section
We have the module, that accepts data from an external source.
We'll need create a layer that taps into some presential logic (width) and passes the data down from the page.

### Build an Product list module
- Build a section for the product list
- Use the product module
- Add a 'more products' list
- Add a page title ontop of the section
- Add a pageWidth wrapper

import styled from 'styled-components'

const ProductSectionWrapper = styled.div``

const ProductSection = () => {
    return <> </>
}
