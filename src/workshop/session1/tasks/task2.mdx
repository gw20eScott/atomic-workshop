### Tasks
These exercises are designed to help get your hands dirty and familair with Atomic Design practises.
If you're stuck at any point, feel free to ask for assistance or check the 'awnsers' folder for some clues and insight.

No one will be reviewing your work or checking on it's "correctness", that is for you to determine with how you plan to adopt the practises and the product you're building / maintaining.

# Task 2 - Build an image wrapping component
Either using the service of NextJS, a CDN or other image service, you'll want to have a singular place that makes that interface or connection.

Images will be needed across the product list and detail page, but will need to support different resolutions.

### Build an Image Wrapping component
- Use the Image service of nextJS
- Support adjustable widths and heights
- Supports adjusting the quality
- Supports optional styling options such as objectPosition & objectFit changes

### Component Template
You can use this template to help get you started

```
import Image from 'next/image'
import styled from 'styled-components'

const ImageWrapper = styled.div``

const ImageElement = () => {
    return <> </>
}
```
