### Tasks
These exercises are designed to help get your hands dirty and familair with Atomic Design practises.
If you're stuck at any point, feel free to ask for assistance or check the 'awnsers' folder for some clues and insight.

No one will be reviewing your work or checking on it's "correctness", that is for you to determine with how you plan to adopt the practises and the product you're building / maintaining.

# Task 3 - Build a Product list module
The module shows a list of compositions, where we can keep track of which products are in our shopping cart.
For now the module will also act as our shopping cart, so you must provide the following:

### Build an Product list module
- Import our Card Composition
- Show 3 products
- List the "added / clicked" products in our 'cart'

### Component Template
You can use this template to help get you started

```
import styled from 'styled-components'

const ProductModuleWrapper = styled.div``

const ProductModule = () => {
    return <> </>
}
```

### Storybook Template

```
export default {
    title: 'Workshop/session1/playground/ProductModule',
    component: ProductModule,
    args: {
        width: '',
        height: '',
    },
};

export const ProductModuleStory = {};
```
